                <li>Not at all! Most of our members started with no prior flying experience. You'll be flying in a two-seater glider with an instructor behind you to guide you through the process. For your first few flights, the instructor will handle takeoff and landing, while you'll take the controls for the rest of the flight! </li>

    content: `
            <ul>
                <li>Our goal is to ensure everyone gets at least one flight before the end of October. During the first two weeks of the academic year, priority will be given to those who purchased their Gliding Club membership early (on the day of the Fresher’s Fair). After most members have had a chance to fly, we’ll prioritise those with the fewest flights. </li>
                <li>If you can drive, you may receive priority. Please <a href="mailto:gliding@imperial.ac.uk?subject=Request%20-%20Priority%20To%20Fly%20Due%20to%20Driving%20Availability" target="blank">email us</a> to let us know if you're available to help with transport. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Gliding is a weather-dependent sport, so your flight time depends completely on the weather of the day. Flights in the winter tend to be shorter due to shorter daylight hours and fog. Autumn and Summer flights are much better due to longer daylight hours and better soaring weather. </li>
                <li>Expect two or three flights per trip. </li>

We kindly ask that you only sign up for trips if you are certain of your availability. Please refrain from making other weekend commitments until you've checked the flying/reserve lists released every Wednesday. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>We offer two launch methods: winch launches and aerotows. If you’re keen to experience both, we suggest starting with an aerotow. It’s a smoother launch, giving you more altitude and time in the air—though it’s also more costly. For a more thrilling (and budget-friendly) option, winch launching is our most affordable and exciting method! </li>
