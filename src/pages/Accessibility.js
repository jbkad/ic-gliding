            <h2>Our Commitment to Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                We are committed to ensuring that our website is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Here are some of the measures we've taken to enhance accessibility:
            </p>
            <h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                Our website is fully navigable using a keyboard. Users can tab through links, buttons, and form fields with ease. We provide clear focus indicators to help users keep track of their position on the page.
            </p>
            <h3>Screen Reader Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
                We use semantic HTML and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks to ensure compatibility with screen readers. This helps visually impaired users to navigate and understand the content more effectively.
            </p>
            <h3>Text Alternatives</h3>
            <p>
                Images and multimedia content on our website are supplemented with alternative text descriptions (alt text). This allows users who rely on screen readers to understand the context of visual elements.
            </p>
            <h3>Colour Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                We have chosen colour schemes that offer high contrast between text and background elements, making content readable for users with visual impairments, including colour blindness.
            </p>
            <h3>Resizable Text</h3>
            <p>
                Users can easily resize text using their browser settings. Our design remains flexible and functional at various text sizes, ensuring readability for users with low vision.
            </p>
            <h3>Consistent Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                Our website features a consistent navigation structure, making it easier for users to find information and navigate through different sections.
            </p>
            <h3>Regular Audits and Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                We regularly audit our website using accessibility tools and welcome feedback from users to continually improve our accessibility features.
            </p>
