            <h1>What is gliding?</h1>
            <p>Gliding is a sport involving flying <strong>an unpowered aircraft</strong> called Gliders (or Sailplanes). These aircraft normally have no method of propulsion and must utilise the weather to maintain altitude and remain airborne. </p>
            
            <h2>How does a glider fly? </h2>
            <p>Gliders are constantly descending relative to the air around them, converting potential energy into kinetic energy. The resulting flow of air over the wings then generates lift in a similar fashion to any other aircraft, powered or unpowered. </p>
            <p>Gliders rely on two main launch methods to get off the ground. These launch methods both take the glider from stationary on the ground to an altitude from which the glider can continue to fly. </p>
            
            <p>Winch launching the primary method of the launch used during training as it is a low cost and rapid method of launch. The glider is attached using a cable to a powerful winch at the opposite end of the runway. As the cable is pulled in the glider will climb upwards at around 45Â° similar to a kite on a string. Once at flying altitude the cable will be released from the glider and the glider is free to fly around. </p>

            <p>Aerotow launching is another method of launching gliders. The glider is towed behind a powered aircraft using a rope until a certain altitude is reached and the glider releases the rope. This launch method is much more expensive and takes a lot longer to climb to the desired altitude however it gives more flexibility than a winch launch as the tow plane could climb as high as you could reasonably want. The height achieved by a winch launch is dependent on the weather conditions and the length of the runway used to launch. </p>
