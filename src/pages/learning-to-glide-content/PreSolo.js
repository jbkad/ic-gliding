                <p>
                    The stages of training are <strong>Pre-solo, White Card, and Red Card. </strong> 
                </p>

                <h2>Pre solo</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Pre-solo stage, you will learn about the effects of controls, launching, circuits, landings, stalls and spins, and launch failure. The Lasham Website says it normally takes 80 to 120 flights to go solo, but Imperial students should require less. We recommend flying at least 3 flights per week for good progression.
                </p>

                <h2>White Card</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing your First Solo, you will start the White Card training. The White Card rating allows you to fly solo on white-sock (calm wind) days without getting a check flight. Prior to obtaining your white card, you will go through a lot of revisions of the pre-solo syllabus. Without the White Card rating, you will still require a check flight every day to fly solo. After doing 20 solo flights, you will be eligible to convert to the Grob 102 single-seater. When you feel confident, you could take the White Card Test to obtain your White Card rating.  
                </p>

                <h2>Red Card</h2>
                <p>
                    The Red Card syllabus prepares you for obtaining the Sailplane Pilot License. You will learn about spot landings, field selection and landings, and flying in red-sock (strong wind) conditions. After passing the 10 written exams, the Bronze flying skills test, and the cross-country endorsement, you will obtain your Sailplane Pilot License which is recognized worldwide.
