            <p>On arrival to the airfield you will watch the morning briefing. This is broadcast on zoom every morning at 9:00 and is recommended watching for those wanting to fly. There always be an experienced member accompanying on a trip who will either join the call for you or provide a link to join. The Lasham morning briefing covers the weather, operational setup for the day and other points relevant to the flying operation. Following this you will be given another briefing by either the supervising committee member or your instructor for the day on airfield safety. </p>
            
            <h2>First flight</h2>
            <p>You will be required to assist in taking our two-seat training glider out of the hangar, preparing it for flight and taking it to the launch point. Once at the launch point you will meet your instructor who will then brief for your first flight. This briefing will involve familiarising with all the controls and instruments of the glider and cover emergency procedures. You will be wearing a parachute while flying and you will be trained in how to operate it, however there is very little chance that you will need it. Parachutes are primarily worn as the seats in the glider are designed to be more comfortable with one on. </p>
            <p>For your first flight your instructor will likely give you the option of either taking a winch launch or an aerotow. An aerotow will give you more flying time as you will release at a higher altitude than a winch however it will be significantly more expensive. A winch launch is potentially a much more exciting launch as you accelerate from 0-60mph in around 2 seconds then climb up 2000ft in under 60 seconds. The instructor will fly the launch and landing but should give you the opportunity to fly the glider in between. You will be taught about the effects of each of the controls and the principles of flying gliders. </p>
